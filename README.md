## ðŸ“£ [IMPORTANT] This repo is being deprecated in favor of [Gitpod reference architecture](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/self-hosted/latest/reference-architecture/single-cluster-ref-arch) and the corresponding [terraform module](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/tree/main/install/infra/single-cluster/aws). 

We have decided to deprecate this module after serving its purpose for almost over a year. We are deeply sorry for any inconvenience this might have caused, but we believe this shift adds a lot of value and ultimately makes setting up Gitpod a much smoother experience.

Overtime, the number of issues the users of this guide run into has risen significantly, and the maintenance of the same has proven to be challenging for us. Moreover, the setup this guide offers is not flexible enough if the user wishes to customise the infrastructure being created. The maintenance of the created infrastructure can be difficult since the guide doesn't provide any continued support.

Hence, after thorough consideration, we have decided to move to a more `Infrastructure as Code(IaC)` solution by providing `terraform` modules that can setup and provision an EKS Kubernetes Cluster for installing Gitpod. We expect moving to such a popular community solution would offer much more flexibility and support for the folks trying to setup Gitpod.

As Gitpod has continued to offer a frictionless development experience, we expect this new solution will provide a frictionless setup experience for the users. We are very excited about this new phase of Gitpod setup and maintenance. ðŸ¤©

# Running Gitpod in [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/en/eks/)

> **IMPORTANT** This guide exists as a simple and reliable way of creating required AWS infrastructure. It
> is not designed to cater for every situation. If you find that it does not meet your exact needs,

This guide exists as a simple and reliable way of creating an environment in AWS (EKS) that [Gitpod can
be installed](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/self-hosted/latest/getting-started#step-4-install-gitpod) into. Upon completion, it will print the config for the resources created (including passwords) and create the necessary credential files that will allow you to connect the components created to your Gitpod instance during the [next installation step](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/self-hosted/latest/getting-started#step-4-install-gitpod).

## Provision an EKS cluster

Before starting the installation process, you need:

- An AWS account with Administrator access
  - [Create one now by clicking here](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/)
- AWS credentials set up. By default, those configs are present in `$HOME/.aws/`.
- [eksctl](https://eksctl.io/) config file describing the cluster.
  - Here is an [eks-cluster.yaml](eks-cluster.yaml) you can use as example.
- A `.env` file with basic details about the environment.
  - We provide an example of such file [here](.env.example).
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed on your machine, or better, a Gitpod workspace :)

### SSL Certificate

Create a public SSL/TLS certificate with [AWS Certificate Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/en/certificate-manager/),
valid for the `<domain>`, `*.ws.<domain>` and `*.<domain>` Domain names.

Once the certificate is issued and verified, Update the `CERTIFICATE_ARN` field in the `.env` file accordingly.

### Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)

Please update the `ami` field in the [eks-cluster.yaml](eks-cluster.yaml) file with the proper AMI ID for the region of the cluster.

| Region       | AMI                   |
| ------------ | --------------------- |
| us-west-1    | ami-04e9afc0a981cac90 |
| us-west-2    | ami-009935ddbb32a7f3c |
| eu-west-1    | ami-0f08b4b1a4fd3ebe3 |
| eu-west-2    | ami-05f027fd3d0187541 |
| eu-central-1 | ami-04a8127c830f27712 |
| us-east-1    | ami-076db8ca29c04327b |
| us-east-2    | ami-0ad574da759c55c17 |

**To start the installation, execute:**

```shell
make install
```

**Important: DNS propagation can take several minutes until the configured domain is available!**

The whole process takes around forty minutes. In the end, the following resources are created:

- an EKS cluster running Kubernetes v1.21
- Kubernetes nodes using a custom [AMI image](https://github.com/gitpod-io/amazon-eks-custom-amis/tree/gitpod):
  - Ubuntu 21.10
  - Linux kernel v5.13
  - containerd v1.5.8
  - runc: v1.0.1
  - CNI plugins: v0.9.1
  - Stargz Snapshotter: v0.10.0

- ALB load balancer with TLS termination and re-encryption
- RDS Mysql database
- Two autoscaling groups, one for gitpod components and another for workspaces
- In-cluster docker registry using S3 as storage backend
- IAM account with S3 access (docker-registry and gitpod user content)
- [calico](https://docs.projectcalico.org) as CNI and NetworkPolicy implementation
- [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) for self-signed SSL certificates
- [cluster-autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler)
- [Jaeger operator](https://github.com/jaegertracing/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/jaeger-operator) - and Jaeger deployment for gitpod distributed tracing
- [metrics-server](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server)
- A public DNS zone managed by Route53 (if `ROUTE53_ZONEID` env variable is configured)


## Update Gitpod auth providers

Please check the [OAuth providers integration documentation](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/self-hosted/latest/configuration/authentication) expected format.

We provide an [example here](./auth-providers-patch.yaml). Fill it with your OAuth providers data.

```console
make auth
```

> We are aware of the limitation of this approach, and we are working to improve the helm chart to avoid this step.

## Destroy the cluster and AWS resources

Remove Cloudformation stacks and EKS cluster running:

```shell
make uninstall
```

> The command asks for a confirmation:
> `Are you sure you want to delete: Gitpod, Services/Registry, Services/RDS, Services, Addons, Setup (y/n)?`

> Please make sure you delete the S3 bucket used to store the docker registry images!
